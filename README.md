# Intro to Machine Learning Labs

https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/MLCodeLab/blob/master/lab1/sentiment_analysis_tutorial.ipynb
## Lab 1: Intro to ML Packages: SKLearn
First, we'll walk through the [sentiment analysis tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/MLCodeLab/blob/master/lab1/sentiment_analysis_tutorial.ipynb) together, and cover how to build and tune models on SKLearn. Next, you'll apply what you learned, and work through the [news group excerise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/MLCodeLab/blob/master/lab1/news_groups_exercise.ipynb) yourself.

We provide a sample solution in the [news group solution](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/MLCodeLab/blob/master/lab1/sample_news_groups_solution.ipynb).

## Lab 2: Intro to DNN Packages: PyTorch
First, we'll walk through the [MNIST tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/MLCodeLab/blob/master/lab2/mnist_tutorial.ipynb) together, and cover how to build and tune models on PyTorch. Next, you'll apply what you learned, and work through the [CIFAR excercise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/MLCodeLab/blob/master/lab2/cifar_exercise.ipynb) yourself. 

We provide a sample solution in the [CIFAR solution](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/MLCodeLab/blob/master/lab2/cifar_sample_solution.ipynb).


## Running the labs
The labs are Google Colaboratory notebooks, so just click the `View in Colaboratory` link on the notebook, and you should be all set!
To save your progress, you can copy the notebooks to your own google drive.
